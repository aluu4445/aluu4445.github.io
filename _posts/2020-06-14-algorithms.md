# Back to OSSU
After a few [detours](https://andyluu.com/learning/cs/2020/05/31/A-few-detours.html) it was time to once again start working through the OSSU curriculum again in April 2020 and after getting through the [basics](https://andyluu.com/jekyll/update/2020/05/31/learning-the-basics.html) I felt like getting into some meatier topics. There were a few options, but I decided to go for the Algorithms / Data Structures course because it was an area that I had never really encountered in the past. There were also Leetcode problems that I struggled with even starting because I didn't know the data structures required to solve them.

# Princeton vs Stanford
I started with the [Stanford course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer) recommended by the OSSU curriculum but my impression after the first two weeks of content was that the course was fairly heavy on the analysis of algorithms rather than data structures so I looked up some other opinions on the course versus a [similar course offered by Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome). It was even [raised as an issue on the OSSU Github repository](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/519) which seemed to echo the other opinions I found that both courses were quite good but emphasised different things. Generally the Princeton course seemed to be recommended over the Stanford course but with the caveat of requiring knowledge of Java. Based on my experience and my partner's positive experience with the Princeton course I decided to make the switch. But first I had to learn Java!

# Learning Java
I did a quick run through the [Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) as an introduction and then worked on the [Java MOOC course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-1/1-starting-programming). In hindsight I would go straight to the Java MOOC course which was more rigorous and hands-on. I stopped about halfway through once I thought I knew enough to start working through the Princeton course which was more or less right. More recently I've decided to focus on learning more advanced Java (more on this in a future course) which may take me back to finish the rest of the Java MOOC course.

# [Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome)
I would **definitely recommend** this course for anyone looking for a course on Algorithms / Data Structures and would even go as far as recommending you learn Java for the sole purpose of doing this course (a fairly basic knowledge of Java is honestly enough).
- The course content was very well explained by a lecturer who clearly understood the content deeply (and even designed one of the data structures taught!)
- A lot of in-depth examples / demos for pretty much every concept presented in the courses
- The historical context of why certain data structures are used over others and what outstanding problems there still are in the design of algorithms was relevant and really interesting
- There is an automatic exercise grader which gives quite detailed feedback on your solutions
- The exercises are well designed and focus on using the data structures to solve a problem, rather than writing the data structures from scratch, which is what you would do as a software engineer anyway
- The main downside is that the audio for some lectures can be difficult to hear without earphones
