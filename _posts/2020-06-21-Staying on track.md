While I was starting my journey of teaching myself how to code, my partner also introduced me to the world of Personal Knowledge Management through tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). In the past I had used Google Keep to track personal notes and task reminders and while its great how simple it is to use, it's quite limited in its ability to manage any substantial amount of knowledge effectively. There's a mountain of tools out there and different things work for different people, but I've been using Roam since the start of 2020 and I found it fairly easy to start using it to help me with my self-learning too.

# Planning it out
I played around with making a Kanban-style plan that factored in the course dependencies and estimated course durations but I ended up with something extremely simple: a list of months where I roughly slotted in courses in the order I wanted to do them, with checkboxes to mark my completed items. It guided my progress and was an easy way to see how I was progressing at a high level. I set it up as a Notion page since I was using Notion at the time, but it could easily be done on any platform. I was [quite flexible with adding different study material to the OSSU curriculum](https://andyluu.com/learning/cs/2020/06/07/A-few-detours.html) and this made it really easy to shift things around.

# Tracking your daily progress
Since I was planning to study in my spare time while working full-time, I knew that setting daily study targets and tracking my progress daily was something that I wanted to do. Luckily I had also started daily journalling on Roam! The section of my daily journal dedicated to my study varied from just quick one-liners to a few paragraphs about what I learnt. I had some rough goals of 1-2 hours on weekdays and 4-5 hours on weekends so it was easy to see for myself at the end of the day whether I was keeping up with this. For the weekends in particular I would recommend setting yourself up with a rough schedule on your calendar app (I used Google Calendar) to help you manage your tasks with the bonus of easily tracking how much time you're spending on different tasks.

# Reflecting on your progress
It was also important for me to take a step back every now and then to ask myself questions like:
- How much progress have I made towards my goals?
- Am I working hard enough?
- Do I need to tweak my study plan?
- Is there anything I need to change?

You could set a reminder to yourself to do this every month on its own but for me it was quite easy to just incorporate this into my monthly goal reviews where I reflect how my progress towards my life goals.
