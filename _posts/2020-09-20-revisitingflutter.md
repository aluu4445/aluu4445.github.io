I was offered a position as a junior software developer after [my interview](https://andyluu.com/learning/cs/2020/09/06/csfundamentals.html)! I'll save my deeper thoughts for a future posts, but my CS learning journey definitely hasn't ended or even peaked - this still feels like an early stepping stone but it's a very important one and one I'm really glad to be on. For now I'd like to share my experiences delving back into Flutter. With still at least another month until I start this new job, I asked if there was anything that I could focus my studies on that could help me prepare for the work I'd be doing - the answer was Flutter!

In my earlier stint with learning Flutter, the first half of [Angela Yu's App Brewery course on Flutter](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/intro-to-flutter) was being offered for free in collaboration with the Google Flutter team. I didn't follow the course too strictly, but it was a great resource to kickstart my Flutter learning and also to watch a few videos here and there on concepts I wanted to understand better. The course was great because:
- The instructor's voice is really easy to understand (even sped up)
- I could watch the videos on 2x speed and still follow
- The instructor is really good at explaining concepts including plenty of visual aids
- The course is really easy to follow even for beginners to programming in general (and certain videos are optional for everyone else)
- The course is structured really well - you follow along with the instructor in writing a set of increasingly complex apps, and there are plenty of points where the instructor encourages you to try something on your own
- If the above isn't convincing enough, the course is pretty much [universally](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/eighz8/best_course_on_udemy_to_start_learning_flutter/) [recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/evkpwz/can_you_recommend_flutter_courses_with_or_without/) [on](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/h11g77/is_angela_yus_course_on_flutter_and_dart_good/) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/irnc6z/what_was_your_experience_with_angela_yus_flutter/)

I'm really glad I dove straight into writing my own app from scratch, now that it was for a job and not just a personal project, I really wanted to go back and do a proper course. With Flutter being relatively new, the free resources available seemed pretty limited, but I was happy to invest in a paid course. I did look at the other commonly recommended Flutter courses like [Maximilian Schwarz's](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) and [Andrea Bizotto's](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-firebase-build-a-complete-app-for-ios-android/), but I just found that harder to follow compared to the App Brewery course so I bought the full course (which was also cheaper at $10 USD).

My only complaint about my experience with the free version of the course was that the concepts were pretty entry-level and there weren't any more advanced topics - but it definitely does ramp up in the second half of the course. As I went through the course properly, I found myself wishing that I had done this in the first place - there are so many things in my [Rain Checker app](https://andyluu.com/learning/cs/2020/07/19/flutter.html) that I either could have written better, or I would've spent much less time trying to learn things from scratch. At the end of the day though, I think it's a really important skill to learn how to figure things out on your own, and jumping into personal projects is a great way to do that.
