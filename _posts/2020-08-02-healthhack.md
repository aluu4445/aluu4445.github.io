Over the last two weekends I took part in [HealthHack 2020](https://www.healthhack.com.au/)!

## How did I end up getting involved?
I was talking to a friend (shoutout to Jason Lim!) about my progress in learning computer science and he mentioned that some people have been running COVID-19 hackathons. I looked up hackathons but most had either been cancelled during COVID-19 or were exclusively for university students. HealthHack was pretty accessible and it was even fully virtual so it was low commitment

## What did I hope to get out of it?
I wanted to experience what a hackathon was like - I wasn't confident in my technical abilities but hoped to do a bit of coding and also experience what it's like to work in a team to develop software to solve a problem.


## What was the experience like?
I almost backed out during the first night but I found the perfect team:
- The problem owner was a former HealthHack organiser so I felt like that'd be a good team for someone new to hackathons
- The problem owner was looking to implement a fairly low tech solution and wasn't looking for any particularly strong software development skills
- The problem (how to help researchers better communicate their research to the public) was pretty close to something I've been thinking about (how to help the public better understand research and news articles citing research)
- I had some great team members with a wide variety of backgrounds who were also beginners at coding

The other teams made some amazing things! Even though I think my team fell short in terms of a final polished solution I'm glad I chose them because:

- I learnt a lot about the product design side of software engineering i.e. the user journey, identifying and addresss pain points, brainstorming and ideation
- I felt like I was able to make some meaningful contributions from a coding perspective.

## What did I enjoy?
- I really enjoyed the process of writing Google Apps Scripts to try and link all our spreadsheets, docs and forms together. There was a lot of problem solving done and I got a lot of JavaScript practice
- I liked the event being virtual. It minimised the disruption to my weekends - I could easily hop off to do other things or multitask them. I've also always been terrible with presentations so it made that experience much less painful.
- I liked how collaborative and non-competitive the event was - having no prizes was definitely a great idea

## What did I not enjoy?
- I was surprised by both the abundant supply and demand of software engineers. Most of the problems specifically asked for team members with UX design or front end / back end software development skills. The majority of people seemed to fall in this category with the remaining working in health-related industries so I felt like a bit of an outsider. 
- There were a few instances where I thought that we were talking things to death or ideas were being brought up for the 10th time that just made me zone out form the discussion
- Two weekends is a pretty big commitment of time and I think the lack of time pressure made everything happen pretty slowly

## Would I do it again?
- Yes! I would do HealthHack or another hackathon again in the future
- I would want to develop my technical skills further so I feel less constrained in the problems I can choose and the contributions I can make. Ideally I'd like to have some experience working as a software engineer first.
- However it would depend if there's a problem that I feel passionate about
