In May 2020 I went through the content of a course called [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). As the name suggests it aims to fill in the gaps of a typical CS degree, or more specifically as the creators describe: "*There’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools".* Here's the curriculum if you're interested:

# Why did I decide to do this course?
The OSSU curriculum is designed to emulate the content of a typical CS degree, and I felt like it also lacked coverage of the typical tools used by computer scientists. For example, I had set up a Github and used the desktop application to maintain my personal repository, but I never really understood how it worked. I found it hard to put aside time to research tools like Git, Bash or Vim and this course felt like a good opportunity to finally learn how to use these tools. It also made sense to learn more about these tools early in my study as I expected to be using them throughout my career.

# What was good about the course?
- For the most part the course lectures were really good at introducing a tool, explaining at a high level how it works, and talking about what it's used for and why it's used. In particular I think the lectures on the shell, Git, Vim and Data Wrangling were the best. The lecture notes were also well written and useful for background before the lecture or a recap afterwards.

- I was introduced to many tools like more advanced shell commands, shell scripts, grep, sed, awk and profilers. Even if I don't remember the details in the future, I'm aware they exist and it's easy to look further into how to use them

- The lectures can be watched on their own in any order without any pre-requisites so even if you're only interested in one or two topics you can still benefit from the course lectures. I found them quite approachable even as a beginner.

# What could be improved?
- My biggest gripe with the course was the lack of solutions to the exercises. I think being able to review the content and trying to apply it to solve problems is an extremely important part of learning and without solutions its pretty difficult to know if you've applied concepts correctly. It was possible to google some of the solutions or work from others but for the most part I was on my own. I do acknowledge that this is normally a course at MIT where you can ask the tutors for assistance though.

- I think the course would definitely benefit from the consistency of having a single lecturer instead of dividing it between three different people. In particular I thought Jon was an amazing lecturer while it was difficult to understand Jose at times (the first few lectures had captions which helped).

- I thought there was also a difference in quality between the courses although there may be some bias because I was more interested in certain tools than others. For example I found the lecture on Git very well explained and illustrated in terms of how it works and why it's used, but the lecture on the Command-Line environment provided relatively shallow coverage of multiple loosely related tools. I can see how the main goal is to introduce the existence of these tools though, so I think more discussion about where/why they're used would be good.

# Final thoughts
Overall I really enjoyed this course and I'd recommend it to anyone also looking to learn more about the tools explored in the course. If going through the whole thing is too much to commit to, just pick the topics that you're actually interested in learning more about!
