As a project manager in the construction field, you encounter a lot of interesting topics that you would otherwise never know about. I've summarised some really interesting things about sandstone that I learned via a report authored by [Jasper Swann](https://www.jasperswann.com.au/stonemason/).

## How does Sydney's sandstone achieve its look?
The sandstone that you typically see on historic sandstone buildings in Sydney CBD has historically been known as [Yellowblock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_sandstone). It actually comes out of the ground with a pale grey-to-white colour but develops the honey/pale-brown colour that it's known for via an oxidation process where minerals within the stone migrate to the surface and react on exposure to the atmosphere.

## Why is there so much variety in colour?

If you look at any Yellowblock sandstone in Sydney you'll notice colour variations ranging from dark brown all the way to orange. This process depends on the process of siderite, which varies in concentration in any given party of the quarry, which leads to unpredictable levels of colouration in the sandstone. Other minerals such as manganese present in varying quantities can also contribution to the sandstone developing a darker/browner colouration. 

## Why is this an issue?
This process can occur anywhere from days and weeks to months after quarrying and can continue for years. Although stone is a natural product and some level of variety in colour/texture can always be expected, there could be substantial colour variations deviating strongly from the design intent that couldn't be picked up at the time of installation. That said, there is already a significant level of colour variation in many existing installations through Sydney CBD and this does not detract from the colour appearance of the building as a whole.

## What can you do if you want to minimise the colour variation?
There are also options available to intentionally alter the surface colour of sandstone that have long been used by suppliers and stonemasons:
1. Acid wash with 2% Hydrochrolic Acid
- This has the effect of removing any brown/grey discolouration due to manganese which leaves allows a relatively uniform golden colouration to develop
- Ideally you could allow the sandstone to all develop naturally and acid wash any significantly discoloured pieces, but the process is much easier to carry out at installation when scaffolding is available
2. Application of a chemical colouring agent
- This has the effect of causing a permanent golden colouration of the surface of the sandstone and is used to add colour to stones that have failed to self-oxidise
