When I was brainstorming ideas for personal projects to work on, I thought about trying to make my own mobile app. Wanting to start with something simple, I decided to make a weather app - with a twist! I've used weather apps and widgets in the past but I normally find myself uninstalling them because the weather in Sydney is pretty stable and most of the time I don't care about the weather. The only time I really care about the weather is when it's going to rain that day and I should probably bring an umbrella. It sounded simple enough - do absolutely nothing except tell me when it's going to rain that day.

## How to get started?
I read some advice that a good way of being motivated to work on projects is to try and use new languages/technologies that you have to learn. I agree! I heard a friend talking about Flutter a while ago and this was the perfect opportunity to learn it. My usual routine of googling and searching through reddit for recommendations of learning resources led me to [the official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), which is actually quite good. Overall it was easy to follow and quite clear, but:
- Be prepared for some pretty huge file downloads
- I ran into a frustrating issue related to the Java JDK version that took me a few hours of attempted debugging before I gave up and posted an [an issue on Github](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/61354)

I watched a few introduction to Flutter videos on Youtube as well, but some of them were outdated and referenced older documentation. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIn-4nRfkUg) was probably the best video I found - made pretty recently and long but quite easy to follow at 2x speed. There are only a few videos on Youtube but App Brewery partnered with the Google Flutter team to provide the first half of the course for free [here](https://flutter.dev/freecourse)! The course is really good at explaining the concepts such that even a beginner could follow along but a more experienced programmer might find some of the lessons pretty trivial. I ended up following closely along with the first few chapters and then skimming through the rest.

## A lot of tinkering
I read through the Dart documentation as well, but didn't spend too much time there because it seemed pretty similar to Java. The main differences so far are things that I've seen in other languages like JavaScript, or syntactic sugar. I knew that the core of my app would be a weather API that provided data for probability of precipitation (PoP), so I started with a search for that. Unfortunately the Flutter weather package uses OpenWeather's API which didn't include PoP, but there is a http package that I could use. It was surprisingly difficult to find a weather API that was both free and included PoP, but after a long search I discovered [weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/)!

At this point I sat down and wrote myself a list of:
- What functionalities I wanted the app to have
- What settings I wanted the app to have
- What problems I expected to have to tackle
- A rough outline of the steps I expected to work through

As of now I've got a pretty rudimentary app set-up and I'm able to extract the PoP data but I have a lot of work to go. It'll be interesting to look back at my progress after I'm done and see how I could have made it easier for me!
