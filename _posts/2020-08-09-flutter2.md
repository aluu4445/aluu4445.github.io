This is Part 2 of my posts about learning Flutter. For Part 1 see my [post about getting started with Flutter](https://andyluu.com/learning/cs/2020/07/19/flutter.html). To recap, I spent some time learning about Flutter and writing Dart code, set up a really basic app, found a weather API that gave me the data I wanted and figured out how the parse the data.

Delving straight into Flutter to try and code the main functionality of my Rain Checker app was really fun! I started off a bit freely but after messing around for half a day with trying to get a settings page and an autocompleting location search going I realised that I really should be working on the core functionality i.e. getting notifications to fire when it detects that its going to rain. Pretty much every app has notifications so it should be pretty simple to get working right? Wrong!

## Why aren't these notifications working?

1. I started off on the wrong foot because I had somehow got the idea that the notifications that pop up on the top of your screen are called push notifications. It turns out they're called push notifications when they're pushed to your device by a server! This led me down a giant rabbit hole of setting up [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/) and trying to figure out how to integrate with my rain forecasting code so it would prepare to issue a notification every day but cancel if it wasn't going to rain.

2. After eventually giving up on Firebase I decided to get the [Flutter Local Notifications package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) working which was way harder than I expected because the readme was quite confusing and the different articles and Youtube videos about it all seemed to implement it in a slightly different way. After managing to get scheduled notifications working I realised that I wouldn't be able to both run my rain checking code and issue a notification when the app wasn't active.

3. Finally after a helpful StackOverflow post I combined the Flutter Local Notifications package with the [Flutter workmanager package](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager) which was finally able to send the notifications I wanted. Slight problem though - sometimes it would work properly and other times it wouldn't. It was time-consuming to test scheduled notifications because workmanager has a minimum periodicity of 15 minutes, but eventually I was able to iron out all the issues in my code to get it working consistently. I had an idea for an app to help developers test scheduled notifications by changing the datetime of the device at a specific rate - maybe for my next app!

4. My notifications have broken a few times as I've tweaked the rest of my code but so far everything's been a quick and simple fix

## Lessons learned:
- Flutter is still quite new so quite often I run into issues that there really isn't much support out there. The Github issues page for the packages was quite useful though
- There was a lot of value in running the example code myself and reading into how different things are implemented to get more familiar with how the package worked 
- When trying to debug a complicated issue a structured approach is really important i.e. change one thing at a time and re-test after each change
- Workmanager itself has some limitations - notifications often don't fire at the exact time its scheduled
