My biggest takeaway from the Princeton Algorithms course ([Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome) and [Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/home/welcome)) was an appreciation for why knowledge about data structures and algorithms (DSAs) is so important to software design. An idea that the course hits on several times throughout these courses is that the choice of a faster DSA can be significantly more impactful to the performance of a progam compared to improvements in hardware or increasing the amount of computing power utilised. 

## Do I even need this information on the job?

Throughout the course, I would wonder things like:
- Do I really need to know how left-leaning red black trees work?
- Do I really need to know how to implement the Knuth-Morris Pratt algorithm?

The general consensus from talking to friends and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ho0o5l/how_data_structure_and_algorithm_is_actually_used/) seems to be that knowing how to specifically implement different DSAs isn't necessary, but knowledge about their properties and impact on time and complexity can be quite important. The course is definitely aware of this and provides you with implementations for almost every DSA it teaches, while still making sure to walk through their properties and how they would be implemented in Java.

Maybe others would even find themselves interested in the field of algorithmic research - the course has a lot of great historical context on how we developed the DSAs in use today and what could potentially be developed in the future.

## Am I ready for interviews now?

Completing the course doesn't make me feel like I'm ready for interviews, but I feel like I've built the foundation for the rest of my study. I can't remember how to implement a heap sort or DFS at the moment, but it's going to be much much easier when I review that again one day.

DSAs weren't something that I really thought about right up until I started working through Leetcode problems and my naive approaches weren't quite cutting it. I'd encounter medium difficulty problems and feel like pieces of the puzzle were missing. I feel like I have most of those missing puzzle pieces now. I'm looking forward to putting some time into Leetcode seeing how much I've progressed - but that'll have to wait for a future post.
