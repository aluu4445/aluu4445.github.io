I started this journey of teaching myself how to code properly on January 1st 2020. I dabbled in Python before this, but it never lasted very long or got very far.

After looking at a variety of options, I ultimately decided on following (the OSSU curriculum)[https://github.com/ossu/computer-science], a curated set of online courses that's been designed to provide essentially the same education as an undergraduate computer science degree.

I haven't followed the course to the letter though - I found that my mathematical background as a civil engineer was probably enough to cover the math requirements and skipped that sections.

Throughout the journey I've also added additional resources like:
- [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/) - a beginner course on HTML and CSS
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) - a course on topics typically not covered like Shell tools, Vim, Version Control, Profiling etc.
- The Codecademy courses on [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- An [extra course on Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-1/1-starting-programming) so I could take the Princeton Algorithms course
- [Regular Expressions for Regular Folk](https://refrf.shreyasminocha.me/) - a great online resource for learning Regex
- I had a go at the 30-day Leetcode challenge in April 2020

Having learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I decided to set up this personal website to practice these skills and also publicly document my progress - such that others can see what I've done and maybe pick up some tips on their own self-study journey.
