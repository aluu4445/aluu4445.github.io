After studying as a Civil Engineer and working as Project Manager for four years, I decided late 2019 that it was time for a career change and I wanted to work in Computer Science. I started this journey of teaching myself how to code properly at the start of 2020 with the plan to work full-time and spend my spare time self-studying to the point where I could switch careers within 1-2 years.

After looking at a variety of options, I ultimately decided on following [the OSSU curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), a curated set of online courses that's been designed to provide essentially the same education as an undergraduate computer science degree.

Throughout the journey I've also studied some additional resources like:
- [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/) - a beginner course on HTML and CSS
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) - a course on topics typically not covered like Shell tools, Vim, Version Control, Profiling etc.
- The Codecademy courses on [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- An [extra course on Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-1/1-starting-programming) so I could take the Princeton Algorithms course
- [Regular Expressions for Regular Folk](https://refrf.shreyasminocha.me/) - a great online resource for learning Regex
- I had a go at the 30-day Leetcode challenge in April 2020

Having learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I decided to set up this personal website to practice these skills and also publicly document my progress. If you're reading this, hopefully you'll find my journey interesting and maybe even helpful!
