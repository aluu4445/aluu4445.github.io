# Before I started
I wasn't quite completely new to programming - I learnt MATLAB as part of Civil Engineering degree and I had dabbled in Python in the past. Back in mid-2019 when I was still considering whether it was a path I wanted to go down, I decided to try and learn Python more seriously. At first I dabbled in [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/) but I ditched it when I reached the paywall and picked up [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/) instead. The idea of learning basic Python while also learning tools that I could potentially apply even in my own work was pretty appealing, but in hindsight I wouldn't really recommend it as a resource to most people. The content is a little too verbose and there isn't really enough interactivity - it's pretty much a textbook after all. I would instead recommended Codecademy's [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) for complete beginners or EdX's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) if you are more familiar with programming.


# Cutting out the fat
The OSSU course suggests a minimum duration of about 2 years but I thought there might be a bit of overlap with my civil engineering background. I tried out some of the math courses but decided I was familiar enough with the concepts and from asking friends in the industry it didn't seem like math was used all too much anyway. I watched the first two modules of MIT's [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm) but the course was pretty low quality and the content seemed too mathematical / theoretical and I dropped it halfway. I also skipped the Introduction to Programming section of the curriculum (Python for Everyone / Fundamentals of Computing) as I was already familiar with basic coding and Python. Instead I looked through the introduction to Python course (mentioned above) and decided to finish the sections on my weaker areas i.e. recursion and classes.

# Learning the basics
I would consider the three courses below the 'basics' and they took me about 2 months to complete (January and February 2020).
## [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science#!)
I would **definitely recommend** this course - it was a really great course for providing an introduction to Computer Science. I would recommend even just the first lecture to anyone remotely interested in learning how to code and I've even shared it with a few friends in this position.
- David Malan is an amazing lecturer
- The online platform for the course content is really high quality and completely free - there's even an inbuilt IDE and you can get really good feedback on the correctness and style of your submissions
- Most exercises included both an easy and hard version of the problem - I was able to do the hardest versions of every exercise but some of them were quite time consuming
- Starting with Scratch was really good but I think learning C could be a difficult experience for the average student even though I appreciate that it allowed the course to teach lower level concepts like memory allocation and pointers

## [How to Code: Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data)
I would **recommend** this course for something getting started with learning CS but not as a first course, but I think you could find alternative courses to cover the concepts too.
- I didn't really understand the value of going back and learning a functional language like Racket but as I got further through the course I could appreciate more how it was used to explain some fundamental concepts like function design, testing and recursion
- The exercises seemed very tedious at first and it felt like a lot of it was copying and pasting templates and following a formula
- Minor exercises between lecture content was behind a paywall but I don't think I missed out on that much
- I enjoyed how the final exercises pulled together

## [How to Code: Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data)
I would **definitely recommend** this course to anyone who finished the Simple Data course - it's pretty much just a continuation into more advanced topics.
- I appreciated the shift away from templating for sake of it and more to guide the process
- It was a good early introduction to some more complicated concepts like generative recursion, backtracking search, DFS, BFS, tail recursion, graphs and merge sort
- Exam was behind a paywall which sucks but exercises towards the end got quite a bit harder and more time consuming anyway (but doable for a student that's been studiously following along)
