This is Part 3 of my posts about learning Flutter. Click here for [Part 1](https://andyluu.com/learning/cs/2020/07/19/flutter.html) and [Part 2](https://andyluu.com/learning/cs/2020/08/10/flutter2.html)

After getting over the unexpectedly tall mountain that was notifications, I wanted to finish the other main functionality - the settings page where the user could change things like:
- their location
- the threshold of rain probability to receive a notification
- the period of time to check for rain
- the time they should receive a notification

Flutter has a [Shared Preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package that provides persistant storage for simple data (which allows settings to be saved) but in my search I found the [Preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/preferences) package which takes it a step further and helps you generate a settings page with a selection of pre-built widgets. This was so easy that I could do it without ever needing to figure out how to use the shared preferences package, but I wanted the Settings page to function a certain way requiring an auto-completing Google Location search, as well as Sliders and RangeSliders which weren't implemented in the package.

The other pre-built widgets were an ideal starting point for writing my own, and only needed a few tweaks to get working. On the plus side this was also a really easy way to learn how it used the Shared Preferences package to achieve the ability to save settings (easier than reading the README!) - I ended up using the Shared Preferences package elsewhere in my code so that was useful. The Sliders and RangeSliders were pretty trivial to write up, but the auto-completing Google Location search was more complicated than it should've been because of how confusing Google Cloud Console is.

I'm pretty happy with how it's come out but I'll still need to implement a feature so that a prompt appears when the app is first installed that redirects the user to the settings page.
