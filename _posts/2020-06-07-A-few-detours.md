I definitely wanted to get through this course as quickly as I could - but I was also pretty open to swapping out courses or learning extra content. I wasn't aiming for any particular job in CS so I felt having a wider set of skills was a good idea too.

# Collaborating on Github
Around the time I finished the basic courses mentioned in [my previous post](https://andyluu.com/jekyll/update/2020/05/31/learning-the-basics.html) my partner suggested that I try making some code changes to an online pictionary project on Github that she had helped put together for an assignment in university. It was a bit of a detour from my plan of getting through the OSSU course but it was definitely a great opportunity to get more familiar with the development loop on Github and collaborating with other people.

As preparation I completed the [Codecademy course on JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) which was a good introduction but it was pretty limited help for working with more advanced code. I think the beginner Codecademy courses on coding is quite beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and interactive, but I compare it a conveyor belt where you never get to stray too far from a pre-determined path. In the end with a lot of guidance and a lot of googling on Angular I managed to fix an issue with mobile scrolling and half-complete an implementation of JavaScript fireworks.

# Dabbling in front-end development
Following up on the basic JavaScript course I did, I decided to complete [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/), an online tutorial on HTML & CSS for beginners. I would **definitely recommend** this for anyone looking for an introduction into HTML & CSS:
- There are great diagrams that clearly illustrate the concepts
- Tutorials are really easy to follow along and verify that you're doing the right thing so far
- There are great links to external resources and further reading
- The biggest downside was the limited depth of the course - I would definitely try and follow up the course content with some separate practice in applying the concepts taught

In my case, I decided to start working on a personal website to practice writing HTML and CSS. As of writing this post I haven't gone too deeply into this but hopefully by the time you're reading this these posts will be up on what I end up making!


# Challenging myself with Leetcode
As April 2020 came I also decided to attempt the April 2020 [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) 30-day-challenge which involved doing a daily problem that increased in difficulty throughout the month. My partner had been studying in preparation for interviews and we decided to do the challenge together. I didn't expect to be able to do all the problems but at the very least I had someone to discuss them with.

After breezing through first half I struggled to complete anything in the middle and practically gave up for the final week of problems. While generally teaching me to think outside the box and plan out my code before diving too deeply in, I also got to get some experience with some newly learned data structures like union-find and binary search trees. I'd like to go back and do some occasional medium difficulty problems once I have better knowledge about Data Structures and Algorithms.
